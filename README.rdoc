= Thor Tasks

Thor is a scripting framework that replaces rake and sake.

I end up using it more as a sake replacement, for system wide tasks.

== Install

You'll need Thor to use any of these.

  $ gem install thor
  
Now install the tasks using this:

  $ thor install http://github.com/jqr/thor_tasks/raw/master/TASK_NAME.thor
  
Or, here's a list of tasks for easy pasting!

  $ thor install http://github.com/jqr/thor_tasks/raw/master/rspec_rename_to_dotspec.thor
